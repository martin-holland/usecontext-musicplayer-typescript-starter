# Tasks:

## Setup:

- [ ] - Add MUI, MUI Iconsand theme
- [ ] - Create simple button to show theme and MUI are working.

Steps:

In this app we want to create a useContext music player that is capable of playing a song. We want to be able to play, pause and stop the song. We also want to involve a playlist that can be played. The playlist should be able to list all songs available. The starting song should be the first song in the playlist. We want to be able to skip track to the next song or go back to the previous song. If the end of the playlist is reached, the playlist should start over from the first song.

Application steps:

- [ ] - Create a useContext music player that is capable of playing a song. We will call this context MusicPlayerContext and put it in the context folder.
- [ ] - We will create types that will be used to define the music player state and the music player hook.
- [ ] - We will create a MusicPlayerContext.tsx file that will be used to provide the music player context to the application.
- [ ] - We will provide access to the MusicPlayerContext in the App.tsx file so that the entire application can access the music player.
- [ ] - Next we will create useMusicPlayer hook, in the hooks folder. This will be a custom hook that will be used to play, pause, stop and skip the song, either forwards or backwards.
- [ ] - Use songs that are in the public folder as the source songs.
